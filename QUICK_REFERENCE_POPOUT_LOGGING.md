## Testing Checklist

### Window Behavior
- [ ] Main window 800x600, cannot resize
- [ ] Clicking Tweaks/Clients/Settings opens pop-out
- [ ] Dashboard button refreshes main window
- [ ] Pop-out windows can resize
- [ ] Pop-outs close when main window closes

### Download Logging
- [ ] Download progress shows in main window log
- [ ] Percentage updates during download (0-100%)
- [ ] MB downloaded / Total MB shown
- [ ] Download speed shown (MB/s)
- [ ] Extraction progress logged
- [ ] Success/error messages appear
- [ ] Color coding works (cyan, yellow, green, red)

- [ ] Sidebar 200px, content 600px
- [ ] Steam news at top of dashboard
- [ ] Action log at bottom of dashboard
- [ ] All buttons functional

---

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Currently none implemented, but potential future additions:

- `Ctrl+T` - Open Tweaks window
- `Ctrl+D` - Open Clients window
- `Ctrl+S` - Open Settings window
- `Ctrl+L` - Focus action log
- `Ctrl+W` - Close active pop-out window

---

## Known Limitations

### Multiple Instances
User can open multiple instances of same window (e.g., 3 Tweaks windows)
- **Impact:** Low - user can close extras
- **Future Fix:** Track window instances, activate existing instead of creating new

### Position Not Remembered
Pop-out windows always open centered, even if user moved them
- **Impact:** Low - centered is usually convenient
- **Future Fix:** Save/restore positions to config file

### Dashboard Button Active
Dashboard button still clickable even though dashboard always shown
- **Impact:** None - just refreshes dashboard
- **Future Fix:** Add visual indicator that it's the active page

## Troubleshooting

### Main Window Too Small
**Problem:** 800x600 feels cramped  
**Solution:** Main window size is locked, but dashboard content is optimized for this size. Pop-out windows are larger (900x700) for comfortable viewing.

### Can't Resize Main Window
**Problem:** Main window won't resize  
**Solution:** This is intentional. Main window is locked to 800x600. Pop-out windows can be resized freely.

### Logs Not Appearing
**Problem:** Download progress not showing in main window  
**Solution:** Make sure main window is visible. Logs only appear in main window dashboard, not in pop-out Clients window.

### Multiple Windows Confusing
**Problem:** Too many windows open  
**Solution:** Close pop-out windows when done. Only Dashboard needs to stay open. Pop-outs are for specific tasks.

- [ ] Remember window positions
- [ ] Prevent multiple instances of same window
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Dockable windows (advanced)
- [ ] Window management settings
- [ ] Log export/copy functionality
- [ ] Download history in log

### Under Consideration
- [ ] Tabbed pop-outs (combine Tweaks/Clients/Settings in one window)
- [ ] Log filtering (show only errors, only downloads, etc.)
- [ ] Log search functionality
- [ ] Notification system for background downloads
