- `NarakaTweaks.Core.dll` - Tweaks, downloads, client switching
- `NarakaTweaks.Launcher.exe` - Main application

## ⚠️ Current Issue: WinUI3 Runtime Dependencies

The executable runs into a "side-by-side configuration" error, which is a WinUI3 dependency issue.

### Why This Happens
WinUI3 requires the Windows App SDK runtime, which isn't embedded in self-contained builds. This is a known limitation of WinUI3.

## 🔧 Solutions

### **Option 1: Install Windows App Runtime** (For End Users)

Users need to install the Windows App Runtime once:
- **Download**: https://aka.ms/windowsappsdk/1.6/latest/windowsappruntimeinstall-x64.exe
- **Size**: ~8 MB
- **One-time install**: Works for all WinUI3 apps

**Pros:**
- ✅ Small download for users
- ✅ Best performance
- ✅ Shared runtime

**Cons:**
- ❌ Requires separate installation step
- ❌ Not truly portable

### **Option 2: Convert to WPF** ⭐ RECOMMENDED

Convert the launcher from WinUI3 to WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation):

**Pros:**
- ✅ True portable executable (no runtime needed)
- ✅ More mature and stable
- ✅ Works on older Windows versions
- ✅ Same modern UI capabilities
- ✅ Better compatibility

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Needs UI conversion (2-3 hours work)

### **Option 3: Use Existing WPF Launcher**

You already have a WPF launcher in `NarakaLauncher/`:
- Add references to new service projects
- Update UI to use new services
- Keep existing WPF structure

**Pros:**
- ✅ Quick implementation
- ✅ Existing UI structure
- ✅ No runtime issues

### **Option 4: Create MSIX Installer**

Package as MSIX for Microsoft Store or sideloading:

**Pros:**
- ✅ Professional distribution
- ✅ Auto-update capability
- ✅ Handles dependencies automatically

**Cons:**
- ❌ Requires code signing certificate
- ❌ More complex distribution

## 📊 Comparison Table

| Method | Portable | Size | Setup Required | Compatibility |
|--------|----------|------|----------------|---------------|
| **WinUI3 + Runtime** | ❌ | 86 MB + 8 MB | Yes | Win10 20H1+ |
| **WPF Conversion** ⭐ | ✅ | ~30 MB | No | Win7+ |
| **MSIX Package** | ❌ | ~90 MB | Auto | Win10+ |
| **Use Existing WPF** | ✅ | ~25 MB | No | Win7+ |

## 🎯 My Recommendation

**Convert to WPF** - Here's why:

1. **True portability** - Single .exe, no runtime needed
2. **Smaller size** - ~30 MB vs 86 MB
3. **Better compatibility** - Works on Windows 7+
4. **Same functionality** - All services remain unchanged
5. **Easier distribution** - Just distribute the .exe

### What Needs Converting (2-3 hours):
- `App.xaml` → Change namespace from WinUI to WPF
- `MainWindow.xaml` → Change controls (NavigationView → Menu/TabControl)
- `MainWindow.xaml.cs` → Same logic, different control types
- `.csproj` → Change from WinUI SDK to WPF

**All backend services remain exactly the same!** ✅

## 🚀 Quick Actions

### To Test Current Build:
```powershell
# Install Windows App Runtime
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://aka.ms/windowsappsdk/1.6/latest/windowsappruntimeinstall-x64.exe" -OutFile "WindowsAppRuntime.exe"
.\WindowsAppRuntime.exe

# Then run
.\publish\win-x64\NarakaTweaks.Launcher.exe
```

### To Convert to WPF:
Let me know and I'll convert the UI files to WPF in about 30 minutes.

### To Use Existing WPF Launcher:
```powershell
# Add project references to NarakaLauncher
cd NarakaLauncher
dotnet add reference ..\NarakaTweaks.AntiCheat\NarakaTweaks.AntiCheat.csproj
dotnet add reference ..\NarakaTweaks.Core\NarakaTweaks.Core.csproj
```

## 📦 What You Can Distribute Now

### If Users Install Runtime:
1. Share `publish\NarakaTweaks-Portable-win-x64.zip`
2. Include instructions to install Windows App Runtime
3. Users extract and run

### For Testing:
The core services work perfectly! You can:
- Create a console test app
- Use the existing WPF launcher
- Test services independently

## 💡 Next Steps - Your Choice

**Option A**: Install Windows App Runtime and test current build  
**Option B**: Convert to WPF (recommended - I can do this now)  
**Option C**: Integrate with existing WPF launcher  
**Option D**: Create MSIX installer package  

Which would you prefer? I recommend **Option B (WPF conversion)** for the best user experience.
