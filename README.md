*Keep the game fair for everyone!*

*Disclaimer: Though the risk of non-reversable issues is small, I am not personally reponsible for any damages the use of this software and proposed tweaks causes. For any issues, please reach out to me via Discord. The app uses your Steam ID, Epic Games ID, NarakaID, and/or XboxGames ID to link your account and fetch public game data. It stores only what’s needed for that feature, and you can remove it any time in Settings.*
