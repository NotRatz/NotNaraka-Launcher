## 🔒 Why No Source Code?

**Source code is kept private to prevent anti-cheat bypass attempts.**

This is standard practice for anti-cheat software. Making detection methods public would allow cheat developers to create bypasses, defeating the purpose.

Only the installer and documentation are publicly available.
